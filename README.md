# valheim.ahk2
A Valheim quality of life script written for AutoHotKeyV2

I was annoyed with the control scheme in Valheim so I wrote this script to correct a few things:
* "long press" of use key will send 25 rapid keypresses to quickly fill up kilns and forges
* pgup key will enable a crafting auto-click for large crafting amounts unattended
* tilde key will enable autorun that you can steer your character without using the 2nd mouse button
* F9 will disable/enable the script

Additionally:
* none of the hotkeys will do anything if valheim.exe isn't the active window
* autorun is disabled by any movement key or a repeat press of the autorun key
* crafting auto-click is disabled with a mouse1 click
